    "What about data?\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "Generally, when you have to deal with image, text, audio or video data,\n",
    "you can use standard python packages that load data into a numpy array.\n",
    "Then you can convert this array into a ``torch.*Tensor``.\n",
    "-  For images, packages such as Pillow, OpenCV are useful\n",
    "-  For audio, packages such as scipy and librosa\n",
    "-  For text, either raw Python or Cython based loading, or NLTK and\n",
    "   SpaCy are useful\n",
    "Specifically for vision, we have created a package called\n",
    "``torchvision``, that has data loaders for common datasets such as\n",
    "Imagenet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. and data transformers for images, viz.,\n",
    "``torchvision.datasets`` and ``torch.utils.data.DataLoader``.\n",
    "This provides a huge convenience and avoids writing boilerplate code.\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use the CIFAR10 dataset.\n",
    "It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’,\n",
    "‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of\n",
    "size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.\n",

    "2. Define a Convolution Neural Network\n",
